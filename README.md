# File System Structure in Unix-Based Systems
Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) organize files in a hierarchical tree structure, starting from the root directory (/). All files and subdirectories branch from this single root, unlike Windows, which uses drive letters (e.g., C:\).

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20dbac7-f3ef-47f8-945d-b13349170696)



## Key Features:
- Root Directory (/) ‚Äì The top-level directory containing all other files and folders.

- Tree-Like Hierarchy ‚Äì Subdirectories (e.g., /home, /etc) extend from the root.

- No Drive Letters ‚Äì Unlike Windows, Unix systems mount all storage under /.

- Case-sensitive paths

# Navigating the File System

| Command                       | Description                               | Example      | Notes                            |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------|
| cd (change directory)         | Moves between directories                 | cd Documents | Moves to "Documents" directory   |
| .                             | Refers to current directory               | ./script.sh  | Runs script in current directory |
| ..                            | Refers to parent directory                | cd ..        | Moves back one level             |
| ls (list)                     | Shows files/directories in current folder | ls           | Add -l for detailed list         |
| pwd (print working directory) | Displays current directory path           | pwd          | Shows full absolute path         |

## Key Notes:

All paths are case-sensitive in Unix/Linux

```~``` refers to your home directory (e.g., cd ~)

Use tab for auto-completion of file/directory names

# Path Type
| Path Type     | Description                   | Example                | When to Use                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Absolute Path | Starts from root (/)          | /home/user/Documents   | When you need a fixed, full location |
| Relative Path | Starts from current directory | ../Downloads or ./file | When targeting nearby files          |


## Key Differences:

Absolute: Always works from any location (begins with /)

Relative: Depends on your current directory (uses . or ..)

# Directory vs. Folder: The Same Thing, Different Terms

| System               | Term Used   | Command                  | What It Creates                      | Visual Representation |
|----------------------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Windows (GUI)        | "Folder"    | Right-click ‚Üí New Folder | A container for files/subfolders     | üìÅ New Folder          |
| Linux/WSL (Terminal) | "Directory" | mkdir new_dir            | A container for files/subdirectories | üìÇ new_dir/            |

üí° Remember üí° When you run mkdir new_folder:

- You're creating a new directory (what Windows calls a "folder")

- The command works exactly the same way whether you think of it as a "folder" or "directory"

- The system creates an empty container called "new_folder" in your current location

- GUI (File Explorer) ‚Üí Calls it a "folder"

- Terminal (WSL/CMD) ‚Üí Calls it a "directory"

- Functionally identical ‚Äì just different naming conventions! 


```bash
$ mkdir new_folder  # Creates a directory (you'll see it as a folder in Windows Explorer)
$ ls
new_folder/  # Now exists (can put files inside)
```


# Working with Files and Directories

| Command | Action                      | Example                     | Critical Notes                         |
|---------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| mkdir   | Create directory            | mkdir project               | Creates new folder                     |
| touch   | Create file                 | touch notes.txt             | Creates empty file                     |
| rm      | Delete file                 | rm notes.txt                | Permanent deletion (no undo!)          |
| rm -r   | Delete directory + contents | rm -r project               | üî¥ Dangerous! Deletes everything inside |
| rmdir   | Delete empty directory      | rmdir project               | ‚ùå Fails if directory contains files    |
| cp      | Copy file                   | cp notes.txt notes_copy.txt | Creates duplicate file                 |
| mv      | Move/rename file            | mv notes.txt project/       | Moves or renames in one operation      |

üí° Key Functional Notes:
1.  ```rm -r``` is the nuclear option - always double-check what you're deleting

2.  ```rmdir``` is the safer alternative for empty directories

3.  ```mv``` serves dual purpose:

   -  ```mv``` old.txt new.txt (rename)

   -  ```mv``` file.txt dir/ (move)

4. All commands operate in current directory unless specified otherwise

| -O     | Uppercase 'O' | Save with original filename | curl -O http://example.com/data.txt        | Saves as data.txt   |


## Mounting

Mounting = Attaching a filesystem (USB, disk, network share) to a directory ("mount point") to access its files.

### Key Paths

```/mnt``` ‚Äì Manually mounted filesystems (e.g., sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mydrive).

## Mounting Windows Drive (C:) in Linux/WSL

In WSL, access Windows drives at:
```bash
/mnt/c/      # Windows C: drive  
/mnt/d/      # Windows D: drive, etc.
```


# **Summary of the relationship between VS Code, WSL, and Windows:**

VS Code is installed on the Windows system, not inside WSL itself. However, VS Code can connect to and work inside the WSL environment. Essentially, Windows treats WSL like a lightweight Linux virtual machine or server. Through the **Remote - WSL** extension, VS Code connects to this Linux environment, allowing you to edit and run code directly within WSL as if you were working on a remote machine.

Additionally, Windows mounts its local drives (like C:) into WSL, making Windows files accessible inside the WSL environment under the `/mnt` directory (e.g., `/mnt/c`). This setup allows smooth interaction between the Windows file system, WSL, and VS Code.

----------

### **Simplified relationship:**

-   **VS Code** runs on Windows.
    
-   **WSL** runs a Linux environment inside Windows.
    
-   **VS Code + Remote-WSL** connects to WSL, letting you work inside Linux.
    
-   **Windows drives** are mounted inside WSL under `/mnt/*`, allowing file access between the systems.


### **Simple Example**

-   You write Python code in VS Code (Windows).
    
-   When you hit "Run":
    
    -   The  **Windows UI**  shows you the output.
        
    -   The  **WSL Python extension**  runs the code in Linux (`/usr/bin/python3`).
 
  ### Command Palette in VScode: 
  
  Accessible through `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux), the Command Palette allows you to execute commands and access various features with ease.

  ## Extensions
  
  One of the most compelling aspects of VS Code is its extensibility. Extensions are add-ons that enhance the editor's capabilities, tailored to different programming languages, frameworks, and development workflows.

  ## Basic Editing
 the basics of code editing in VS Code:
 - Open a file by clicking File -> Open or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+O (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+O (Mac).
 - Save your changes with Ctrl+S (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+S (Mac). You can use essential editing commands such as cut, copy, paste, and undo with familiar shortcuts.
 - You can move any line by pressing Alt

# Package manager

Python package management helps you easily install, update, and manage the libraries your projects need within isolated environments.
- This is essential in Python because projects often rely on external libraries (called packages) that may have different version requirements. Without isolation, installing packages globally can cause version conflicts across projects.
- A Python environment acts as a separate workspace with its own Python interpreter and packages, keeping projects independent and conflict-free.
### The main benefits of using a package manager like Conda are:

- Dependency management: It automatically installs compatible package versions.

- Environment isolation: You can work on multiple projects without conflicts.

- Reproducibility: Others can easily reproduce your setup by recreating the same environment.

Overall, using Conda (especially through Miniconda) gives Python developers a powerful, flexible way to manage packages and create stable, shareable development environments‚Äîparticularly useful in data science and scientific computing. At the core are package repositories like PyPI (Python Package Index) and Conda Forge, which are online hubs where developers share packages. To install these packages, we use package managers ‚Äî the most common are pip (which installs Python packages from PyPI) and conda (which installs both Python and non-Python packages, often as ready-to-use binaries, from Conda channels).

| **Command**                            | **Description**                                                          |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `conda create --name my_env python=3.10` | Creates a new environment with a specific Python version.  
|`conda create -n my_env python`          |Creates a new environment with the latest python version. `-n` is = `--name`|
| `conda activate my_env`                 | Activates the specified Conda environment.                               |
| `conda deactivate`                       | Deactivates the current environment and returns to the base environment. |
| `conda env list or conda info --envs`    | Lists all available Conda environments.                                  |
| `conda env remove --name my_env`        | Deletes the specified environment.                                       |

## Note:

If you want to create a new environment with the **latest version of Python** and from the **conda forge** channel:
use this command: 
- `conda create -n myenv python -c conda-forge`
### Breakdown:

- `-n myenv` ‚Üí names the environment myenv (you can change it).

- `python` ‚Üí installs the latest Python version available in conda-forge.

- `-c conda-forge` ‚Üí pulls everything from the conda-forge channel

# Installing and Managing Packages
| **Command**                          | **Description**                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `conda list`                         | Lists installed packages in the activated environment.                                                                     |
| `conda install PACKAGE_NAME`         | Installs a package (must activate environment first). Example workflow: `conda activate my_env` `conda install numpy`      |
| `conda install PACKAGE_NAME=VERSION` | Installs a specific version (e.g., numpy=1.25). Example:  `conda install numpy=1.25`                                       |
| `pip install PACKAGE_NAME`           | Installs a package using pip (use within activated Conda env). Example: `conda activate my_env` `pip install PACKAGE_NAME` |
| `conda update PACKAGE_NAME`          | Updates a specific package. Example: `conda activate my_env` `conda update numpy`                                          |
| `conda update --all`                 | Updates all packages in the activated environment. Example: `conda activate my_env` `conda update --all`                   |
| `conda remove PACKAGE_NAME`          | Uninstalls a package. Example: `conda activate my_env` `conda remove numpy`                                                |


### commands for creating envs and installing packages:

| Command       | Typical Structure                 | Your Example                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| conda create  | create -n NAME [PACKAGES] [FLAGS] | create -n myenv python -c conda-forge |
| conda install | install [FLAGS] [PACKAGES]        | install -c conda-forge jupyterlab     |

Because:

- install doesn't require a positional argument first

- Flags like `-c` typically come before the package names

- The channel applies to all packages listed after it

# Environment Sharing (YAML Files)
Conda allows you to export the environment configuration to a YAML file and recreate the same environment on another system.

| **Command**                                                  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `conda activate my_env` `conda env export > environment.yml` | Saves the environment configuration to a YAML file.                                                              |
|`cat environment.yml`                                          |It shows all that is included in that file|
| `conda env create -f environment.yml`                        | Creates a new environment from a YAML file. Replace `environment.yml` with the filename of your environment file |

# Conda environments in Vscode

- To run your code on windows terminal, run the command: ` python main.py`. Change `main.py` with the address of your file. Because I was in the same directory, I just wrote the name of the file.

# Setting up Jupyter Notebook with Conda in VS Code


- First activate the environment and then run the following command to install Juoyterlab in that env: `conda install jupyterlab`

- After installation, you can find Jupyterlab in your list; however, to search specifically, run the command:`conda list | grep jupyter`, so, it lists just those which have jupyter

- To launch jupyterlab after installation, run the following command in the terminal: `jupyter lab`

### Relationship between Jupyter, ipykernel and python

***Python***:

- The actual programming language that executes your code. Like a car's engine (raw power).

***ipykernel***:

- A translator that lets Jupyter talk to Python. Like a car's dashboard controls (steering wheel, pedals) that send commands to the engine.

***Jupyter (Lab/Notebook)***:

- The user interface where you write and see code/output. Like the car's interior (seats, speedometer, touchscreen).

### How they work together
