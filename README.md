# Placeholder

Placeholder in Python is like a temporary spot or marker in your code where you plan to put some specific information later. It's a way to say "I'll fill in this part with actual data when I need to."

In other words, Placeholders are part of a broader concept called string formatting. They allow for dynamic string creation and manipulation.

## 
What does a placeholder look like?
In Python, placeholders are often written with curly braces {} inside a string.

When do we use placeholders?
We use them when we want to create a string that will have some parts filled in later with specific values.

```bash
name = "Bob"
age = 30
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(message)
```
